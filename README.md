ocument-based Question Answering System
An AI-powered NLP model that predicts answers from questionâ€“answer datasets using PyTorch and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
The system preprocesses text, tokenizes input, builds a custom vocabulary, and converts words into embeddings for training.
Trained with CrossEntropyLoss and the Adam optimizer to achieve accurate answer predictions.
